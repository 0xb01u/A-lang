# _A_ language interpreter

This is a fork from the original GitLab repository this project was developed on, cleaned and reorganized for a better public viewing.

## Original README (translated):

_A_ is a minimalistic programming language based upon the very well-known _C_ programming language. It supports basic arithmetic operations, predefined mathematical functions, and data reading and printing.

This interpreter was developed as the final project for the course _Gramáticas y Lenguajes Formales_ (Formal Grammars and Languages), from University of Valladolid's degree on Software Engineering.

## Credits

The original project was developed by _Grupo G_: **Manuel de Castro Caballero**, **María Ruiz Molina** and **Andrés Trigueros Vega**.

The interpreter was highly based on **Dušan Kolář**'s small interpreter (from his lecture _Building a Small Interpreter_ on the 17th-19th April 2018).
